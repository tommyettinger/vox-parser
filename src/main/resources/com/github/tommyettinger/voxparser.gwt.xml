<!-- To compile to Gwt, you need to reference this file in your master .gwt.xml
     file (usually called GdxDefinition.gwt.xml) as follows:

     <inherits name="com.github.tommyettinger.voxparser" />
-->
<module>
    <!-- This relative path points to the folder that has sources in it.
         This path is slash-separated and is relative to this file. -->
    <source path="voxparser"/>
    <!-- This is a good idea because so much GWT-specific code needs libGDX,
         like the libGDX reflection code. These "inherits" names are period-separated. -->
